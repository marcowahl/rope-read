** Motivation

You don't need to move much these days in front of your machine.  Just
press some keys with your fingers and occasionally you possibly stir
the mouse.

But when you read there is this humiliating effort to reposition your
eyeballs to the other end of the line.  How stressfull is that?  How
depressing?  How 2017?

It's 2018!  To some extend rope read comes for the rescue.  rope read
saves eye movements.
